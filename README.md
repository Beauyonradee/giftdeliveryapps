# Gift Delivery App
A hybrid mobile app that lets users schedule, order, and manage gift deliveries across client, server, and cloud database layers.

This project was developed as part of my Master of IT coursework. It is a full-stack hybrid mobile application for scheduling and managing gift deliveries. The app includes features such as user login, sign-up, placing orders, viewing past orders, and deleting order history. It was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Atlas, and deployed as a Cordova hybrid app on Android.

## List of tools
- Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery Mobile
- Back-End: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB Atlas
- Deployment: Cordova, Render
- Tools: Postman (API Testing), VS Code, Android Studio

## Key Features
- User login and registration with form validation
- Order a gift by selecting from a product list
- View and delete past orders stored in MongoDB
- Backend REST API (GET, POST, DELETE) for managing users and orders
- Hybrid deployment using Apache Cordova

## Reflection
This project helped me understand the full development cycle of a mobile app. I learned how to structure client-server-database interaction using Express and MongoDB, and how to turn a web app into a mobile-ready hybrid app using Cordova. I also gained experience in debugging, API testing, and handling real-time data storage.
